<h1>About Me:</h1>
<h2>hi, Arijit Hisabia here!</h2><p>As an artist, my first love will always be crafting the visual. Through Juno I was able to leverage my creative skills with an incredible web development toolkit, and now I spend most days branding, designing and building out web interfaces as a freelancer.</p>

<p>Coming from a background in design, I love creating pages where I’m able to actually create enjoyable interactions and experiences for everyone! And with Juno’s education and support.</p>

<h2>Interstellar(2014)</h2>

<p>Personally, I think Interstellar truly delivers as Christopher Nolan's best masterpiece. Maybe the general population would put this blockbuster seventh place in the category of the 10 best space movies. I for one would rank it third behind First Man starring Ryan Gosling and Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity respectively.</p>

<h2>World War Z(2013)</h2>

<p>I found this film very entertaining in terms of visual spectacle despite the fact that the zombie scheme is well over-worked and just about been stretched in as many directions as possible by now, the only surprises left available being those which are largely dependent upon modern-cinema technological advances coupled of course with the imagination of those involved in the development stages.
    <p>As far as story-line is concerned the notion that a zombie 'pandemic' has somehow broken out I found novel, but think that how it broke out to have been explored in more detail would have 'filled' it out better with no more than a 'flash-back' sequence being required for that purpose I'd say, the pretty much non-stop action theme over-all however, kept me involved on a continuous basis and apart from one or two difficult to accept scenes (the commercial jet-liner crash for instance) was at the right pace and content level.
    <p>Acting credibility will always be the main problem I think for such attempts at convincing the watching public as to the believability of such films necessary even if only for a couple of hours and I was impressed by the leads in this particularly (of course) Brad Pitt who despite or perhaps because of his own vested interests at stake in terms of production, did a great job with great alround support.
    All in all an enjoyable film in my opinion for what it's worth and as I said at the top very entertaining - to the tune of four stars.</p>

    <h2>The Dark Knight(2008)</h2>

<p>'The Dark Knight' is undeniably one of the best movies ever created. There is not a moment in watching this film that you will ever be bored. It hooks you from the beginning, and never disappoints in the end. 

    <p></p>The casting of this film is one of the most spot-on and perfect fittings in cinematic history. Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face/Harvey Dent, and evidently, Heath Ledger as the Joker. 
    
    <p></p>Ledger's Joker is unmistakably one of the most amazing and breathtaking performances in history. I don't think there could be anyone that can portray the Joker as well as he did. He took a dark, psychopathic and sadistic character and brought him to life- in the most hair-raising way.
    Eckhart's Dent transitioned from what Gotham saw as the classic hero, to the ideal villain. I loved what they did to his character, and they gave him phenomenal scenes and lines. 
    I think Bale depicted Batman flawlessly. He somehow made the audience relate to Bruce, even if his character isn't meant to be that relatable. He showed Batman's frustration, happiness, and grief, so well, you'd feel like you're right there, watching him go through everything. 
    All other characters, even if not main ones, have still made memorable impressions. 
    
    <p></p>Christopher Nolan is a genius. The direction he took this film is incredibly canny- you can tell how dedicated he was. Every detail he added to TDK is necessary. There are no unneeded lines, plot details, characters- anything. He truly made the perfect superhero/supervillain sequel.
    
    <p></p>I can recommend this to anyone that loves Batman, superhero films, or is just looking to watch an incredible movie.</p>
    
<h2>The Amazing Spider-Man(2012)</h2>
<img src="./sp.jpeg" height="500">
<p>My No1 Marvel comics hero , this film I loved truly and will always hold the top charts 
 The back stories of both hero and villain are top notch , the maturity of this film grasps me the most , Spidys suit is badass in this film and Garfield played this role to the best , wish he carried on in the film series.
    <p></p>Tobey was to emotional , Tom is to emotional and unstable sure he plays a good spiderman as well but he doesn't fit the role for me.
    Garfield goes through emotional scenes but he is mature and carries the humour amazingly , out of all the spidey films these 2 films give me goosebumps every time I watch them thats the impact it gives me.
    Emma stone does gwen perfectly , they actually make the perfect couple imo , I felt more of a connection with their relationship in these films than the other spidey films , when you see them together you actually smile.
    Doc Conners aka lizard played a awesome role , very aggressive and destructive , his cgi till this day is perfect , was really fun seeing the fight scenes , film was never dragged nore boring at any moment.</p>

    <h2>Fury(2014)</h2>
    <img src="./fury.jpeg" height="530" alt="fury poster">
    <p>I hate war movies but somehow ended up watching this one and I thought it was excellent. One complaint some people had about the movie is lack of character development. It's true, we don't see the typical pre-war story lines with scenes of young Johnny on the farm with momma and daddy and sister Susie or the hazy flashbacks of the beautiful woman left behind. We learn nothing specific about the characters' lives outside of this war, this tank and the jobs they are assigned within it. But there is enough development within these confines for viewers to learn to understand how the mix of tension, conflict, dislike, and also friendship, solidarity and intimacy all intertwine to create complicated and well-developed characters without the hokey homefront scenes usually contrived to tug at the heart strings - they aren't needed here. 
        <p></p>Brad Pitt is great as always but Shia Lebaouf is the standout in my opinion even though it seems like the young Norman is the character designed to capture the viewers' affinity. 
        <p></p>As mentioned there are no flashbacks or scenes of civilian life sprinkled in to breakup the war zone scenes. The entire movie is literally shot in war zones and active battlefields, much if it even inside the tank which seems like it would be monotonous or boring but you'll be surprised how engaging it is. It is definitely worth the watch.</p>

<h2>The Green Mile(1999)</h2>
<img src="./The Green Mile _ Yeşil Yol.jpeg" height="530" alt="green mile poster">
<p>Before this film, I thought that crying during movies was behind me; I was dead wrong. Frank Darabont’s direction combined with Thomas Newman’s score are just the beginning of this cinematic blessing from God. RIP Michael Clarke Duncan aka John Coffey, and same to you Michael Jeter aka Eduard Delacroix. This film inspired me to be a better person, and it got me through a difficult point in my life. I can relate to the film’s themes of loneliness, as I have been mistreated lately and needed something to let it out with.

    <p></p>While some criticism is aimed at its length (3 hours), I strongly feel that if it were shorter, it wouldn’t have made even half the impact it did on me. I’ve seen it a dozen times, and each time I’m not ashamed to admit that I am bawling in tears. Tom Hanks, James Cromwell, the aforementioned actors above all deliver performances that make you feel like you’re watching something that actually happened.
    
    <p></p>My advice to parents: show your kids this the moment they hit a hard time in their life; The Green Mile will be better than any therapy sesssion ever will. With John Coffey’s inspiration, we might be able to live happier than he was. God Bless the Green Mile, and God Rest the Souls of its departed cast.</p>
